# Superstore-Sales-Performance-dashboard
I build an interactive and user-friendly dashboard to analyze and visualize the sales performance of a superstore using Tableau and provide actionable insights.

## Overview
This project showcases an interactive dashboard created using Tableau to analyze the sales performance of a superstore. By leveraging the Sample Superstore dataset, this dashboard provides actionable insights into key metrics such as total sales, profit, and trends over time.

The dashboard is designed to be visually appealing, user-friendly, and interactive, with filters and parameters for enhanced customization.

## Objectives
1. Analyze sales performance across regions, categories, and customer segments.
2. Provide an overview of total sales, profit, and volume.
3. Visualize sales trends and distribution across various dimensions.
4. Enable users to interact with the dashboard via filters and parameters for dynamic insights.

## Features
### Dashboard Components
1. Total Sales: Displays overall sales in thousands.
2. Total Profit: Highlights the total profit in thousands.
3. Total Volume: Shows the total sales volume (non-currency value).
4. Sales Per Customer: Displays the average sales per customer in thousands.
5. Pie Chart: Visualizes the percent of total sales by region using a Summer Color Palette.
6. Bar Chart: Displays the top N states by sales with a parameter for N.
7. Bubble Chart: Visualizes sales by sub-category, categorized by color.
8. Line Chart: Shows the sales trend by Month-Year.

## Filters and Interactivity
### Filters:
1. Order Date (Range of Dates)
2. Segment (Multiple Values Dropdown)
3. Ship Mode (Multiple Values Dropdown)
4. State (Multiple Values Dropdown, not applied to the bar chart)
### Actionable Filters:
1. Pie Chart and Bubble Chart act as filters to refine other views.
2. Parameter: User-defined input to select the top N states in the bar chart.

## Design and Layout
1. Fixed dashboard size (1055 x 850 px) for a consistent viewing experience.
2. Horizontal and vertical containers for a clean and structured layout.
3. Custom formatting of filters, chart borders, and titles.
4. Fit views optimized for “Entire View.”

## How to Use
1. Open the Superstore_Sales_Dashboard.twbx file in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.
2. Interact with the dashboard using the provided filters and parameters to explore the data.
3. Use actionable filters on the Pie Chart and Bubble Chart for deeper insights.

## Instructions to Recreate
1. Connect to the Sample Superstore dataset in Tableau.
2. Ensure the connection is an Extract, not a live connection.
   
### Create the following visualizations:
1. Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Volume, Sales Per Customer
2. Pie Chart, Bar Chart, Bubble Chart, Line Chart
3. Apply the specified formatting, filters, and interactions.
4. Arrange components in a fixed-size dashboard as outlined in the requirements.
5. Publish the dashboard to Tableau Public or save as a .twbx file for submission.
